Figure out what is taking time during synthesise. Some ideas:

- Accumulators
- Weight storage?
- requantization logic?
- input muxes from the PEs
- weight indexing muxes from the PEs
- ITS THE HUGE ADDER TREE FROMM THE MULS INTO THE ACCUMULATORS!


Also chisel generate one input port for eachh element of the input matrix in the first layer.
- We probably need some "glue" code to talk to the host or whatever


Weight-stationary SA!
