--- Design ---

chisel4ml-fold extends chisel4ml with the ability to time-multiplex (aka fold) layers. chisel4ml-fold is not a fork of chisel4ml. Instead, chisel4ml-fold is a from scratch rewrite that brings in abstractions deemed useful.

The repository is **currently** structured like so:
- abstractions/
- hw/
- sim/

The abstraction directory defines structures and interfaces that are implemented twice. Once in the hw/ directory and once in the sim/ directory. The hw/ implements the abstractions as chisel modules, while the sim/ directory essentially emulates the chisel implementations. 

There will be a Python frontend, similar to chisel4ml, that transform qonnx graphs into an IR (LBIR from the original chisel4ml or something else). This IR is then mapped into the parameterizable hw/ modules which form a synthesizable circuit.
